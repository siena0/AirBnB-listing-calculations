# AirBnB-listing-calculations
## Week 1 Project for Python for Data Science course with CoRise
- This code takes AirBnB data in Amsterdam (price, latitude, longitude), and given a location (Van Gogh Museum in my case), provides a map of listings in the area that fall within a 100â‚¬ budget.
- You can see the outcome of this project [here](https://siena0-airbnb-listing-calculations-streamlit-app-5s2lkx.streamlit.app/) hosted by streamlit.io
- This project was useful to learn more about NumPy libraries.
